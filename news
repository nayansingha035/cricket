"content" :"The ongoing covid pandemic has brought some significant hurdles in almost all the fields. Be it the economy, sports, entertainment, each field has been heavily affected by this crisis. The world of sports has also witnessed the cancellation as well as delays in the conduct of leagues and matches.\n\n

One of the major reschedulings was of the IPL (Indian Premier League). Both in the years 2020 and 2021, the IPL had to face rescheduling. In the year 2020, the tournament was postponed to the second half. This year, the tournament commenced on the 9th of April. However, it got suspended midway due to covid isolation as well as a rise in the cases.\n\n

The second half of the tournament is scheduled to be held from the 19th of September, 2021. The venue has been changed to the United Arab Emirates. The BCCI is excited to bring Oman within the circle of sports. The committee believes that it will help in encouraging the younger generation to get involved in the game more. The first match of the season was between Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore.\n\n

The first half of the tournament saw 30 matches. The second half will have 31 matches starting from the 19th of September. Fans are expecting some exciting matches in the second half. However, there were some speculations that some of the international players won’t be joining the game due to covid restrictions. \n\n

After the suspension of the tournament, on May 29th, England And Wales Cricket Board announced that it won’t allow its players to participate in the 2nd half of the game. The ongoing pandemic demanded several precautions to be taken by the players. The teams that will be extremely affected by the pulling out of players are Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals and Kolkata Knight Riders.

The Cricket Board of England During the months of May and June were quite unsure of the English Players taking part in the 2nd half of the tournament. However, the board has now confirmed that the English players will be taking part in IPL 2021. England’s pre-scheduled tour to Bangladesh was one of the reasons that the cricket board was unwilling to allow players into participating in IPL. The turn of events and postponing of the same resulted in the change of the decision. "
